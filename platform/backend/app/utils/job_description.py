"""Shared helpers for extracting a Job's description from upstream raw_json.

Regression finding 97: `JobDescription.text_content` was empty for the
majority of rows in prod. Resume ATS scores collapsed into 4 distinct
values across 600+ rows because `_extract_job_keywords` received
`description_text=""` and fell back to the role-cluster keyword baseline
— so every infra job produced the same 18 matched/missing lists and a
byte-identical score.

The root cause: no step in the scan pipeline ever populated
`JobDescription`. The fetchers dumped the whole upstream payload into
`Job.raw_json`, and `_upsert_job` never looked at the description fields.
`GET /jobs/{id}/description` had its own ad-hoc fallback against
`raw_json`, but the scoring task read only from `JobDescription` and
therefore saw nothing.

This module centralises the per-platform key mapping so both the scan
pipeline (prospective fix — writes to `JobDescription` on every upsert)
and the scoring task (retroactive fallback — reads directly from
`Job.raw_json` when the row is missing) agree on where the text lives.
