"""Redis-backed scan concurrency locks (Finding 82).

Before this module existed, `POST /api/v1/platforms/scan/all`,
`/scan/{platform}`, `/scan/board/{board_id}`, and `/scan/discover`
all called `scan_task.delay()` with no dedup. A double-click on
"Run Full Scan" queued two tasks that each iterated 871 boards,
doubling the outbound rate to Greenhouse / Lever / Himalayas etc.
and risking HTTP 429 or an IP ban.

This module adds an atomic `SET key NX EX ttl` lock in Redis per
scan scope. The endpoint acquires before `.delay()`; if the
lock is held, it returns 409. The Celery task releases the lock
in its `finally` block, so back-to-back scans are possible once
the previous one finishes. The TTL is a safety valve: if the task
dies without releasing (process kill, unexpected exception before
`finally`, etc.), the lock auto-expires.

Two client flavors: `acquire_scan_lock` (async, for FastAPI) and
`release_scan_lock` (sync, for Celery tasks — Celery tasks run
synchronously even when the web side is async).
