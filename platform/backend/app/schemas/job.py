# state and quietly fell off `?status=new` queries, under-counting the

# "expired" status predate the F99 vocabulary cleanup and still need to be
# filterable; (b) `hidden` is a user-driven workflow state (reviewer hid
# this row from their queue) that's written via JobStatusUpdate, while
# `expired` is set by the scan worker. The write and filter vocabularies

# live rows (linkedin 1.6k, weworkremotely 391, remoteok 197, remotive 25).
# Shipping the narrow list would have 422'd `?platform=linkedin` on the
# frontend's real dropdown, breaking 2.2k rows of visible jobs. The source
