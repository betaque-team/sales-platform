"""Pydantic schemas for platform credential CRUD.

Regression finding 77 (stored XSS) + 79 (body: dict API hygiene):
`POST /api/v1/credentials/{resume_id}` previously declared `body: dict`,
so `profile_url` was stored verbatim. A `javascript:` scheme survived
storage and, when the frontend rendered it as `<a href={…}>`, any
subsequent click executed JS in the viewer's session. `rel=noopener`
does NOT block `javascript:` execution.

This schema closes the gap: `profile_url` is scheme-checked (http/https/
relative only), and `platform`, `email`, `password` get proper typing
so a malformed payload fails fast at request parse time with a 422
instead of crashing a `.strip()`/`.lower()` call later.

The URL-scheme validator mirrors the private helper in
`schemas/feedback.py` (`_validate_optional_url`). Kept local rather
than cross-imported — identical logic, zero runtime coupling between
unrelated schema modules.
