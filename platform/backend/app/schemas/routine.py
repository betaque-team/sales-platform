"""Pydantic schemas for the Claude Routine Apply feature.

Everything the routine / UI exchange over the wire is declared here.
Kept in one file because these types only make sense as a set — a
submission references a run, a run contains submissions, and the
confirm-submitted payload is what mints both.

Validation choices:
- All fields capped with explicit max lengths (Finding 80 / 183 class:
  unbounded Text columns inflate responses and invite DOS).
- ``model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`` on every request
  model so a frontend typo 422s instead of silently dropping fields.
- Enum values expressed as ``Literal[...]`` at the boundary, not
  free-text — consistent with existing cover-letter / credentials
  schemas.
