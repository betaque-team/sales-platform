    """Return the next batch of unreviewed jobs, prioritized by discovery
    recency → CURRENT REVIEWER'S resume fit → platform relevance.

    Ordering (each tier DESC, NULLS LAST):
      1. ``DATE(first_seen_at)``    — today first, then yesterday, then older.
         Bucketing by calendar date (not timestamp) so the UI can surface a
         single "12 today / 8 yesterday" summary that matches the order.
      2. ``ResumeScore.overall_score`` for **the reviewer's own active
         resume**. Jobs the reviewer's resume hasn't been scored against
         yet fall to the bottom of this tier (coalesced to -1).
      3. ``Job.relevance_score``     — platform-wide role/geography match.

    Pre-fix this used ``MAX(ResumeScore.overall_score)`` across **every
    resume on the platform**. Real-world bug: a reviewer with a DevOps/SRE
    resume would see Data-Engineer / Automation-Engineer roles ranked at
    the top of their queue because some other team-mate's data-engineer
    resume scored those jobs at 90+. The team-wide max blew Sarthak's
    own ranking out of the water for any job a different specialist
    happened to fit. The right semantics for a per-reviewer queue is
    per-reviewer scoring — anyone else's fit is irrelevant to what
    *this* reviewer should triage next.

    If the reviewer has no active resume (``user.active_resume_id`` is
    NULL), the subquery returns no matching rows, every job's
    ``my_score`` coalesces to -1, and tier 2 collapses — ordering then
    falls back to ``Job.relevance_score`` which is correct for
    resume-less admin browsing.

    Also excludes jobs the *current reviewer* has already decided on
    (NOT EXISTS against reviews.reviewer_id), which is defense-in-depth
    against any future flow where a review is recorded without flipping
    ``Job.status`` off ``"new"``.

# from the hostname, fetch the single posting via that fetcher's single-job
# API, and run the result through the same `_upsert_job` pipeline the
# scanners use so classification, geography, and relevance scoring behave
# identically to scanned rows. Provenance is captured on two new columns:
# `Job.submission_source="manual_link"` and `Job.submitted_by_user_id`.
# Idempotency is free via the existing UNIQUE(external_id) — re-submitting
# the same URL returns the existing job with `is_new=false`.
