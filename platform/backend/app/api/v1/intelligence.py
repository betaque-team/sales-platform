    Regression finding 176: raising the threshold from `<=3` to `<=4`
    (F167) eliminated the worst offenders (`rust`, `nist`, `bash`) but
    left 5+ char tokens like `"scala"`, `"observability"`, `"cloud"`,
    `"compliance"` in the substring branch — and "scala" still matched
    "scalable", "observability" still caught shorter "observ..." stems,
    "cloud" matched "cloudformation" double-counted, etc. The result
    was systematic on-resume false positives for every user ("Yes, you
    know scala!") that made the skill-gaps dashboard actively misleading.

    Fix: always use a non-word-character boundary check
    (negative lookbehind+lookahead on word chars) for every skill
    regardless of length. This is stricter than a plain word-boundary
    — word-boundary fails for tokens ending in non-word chars like
    `c++` (no boundary between `+` and space) — but
    lookbehind/lookahead on word chars gives us a proper "not
    preceded/followed by a word char" gate that works for `c++`,
    `ci/cd`, `tcp/ip`, and every plain-word token. Multi-word skills
