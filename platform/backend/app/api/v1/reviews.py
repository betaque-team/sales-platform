# --- Feature C: "Applied" action from the review queue -----------------------
#
# POST /reviews/apply — a reviewer hits the fourth review-queue button
# ("Applied", P shortcut) to mark a job as actually submitted, not just
# "worth pursuing". Applied implies Accept, so the handler atomically:
#   1. Creates a Review row with decision="accepted" (so analytics and
#      /jobs/review-queue exclusion treat it identically to a plain Accept).
#   2. Flips Job.status="accepted".
#   3. Creates/updates the company's PotentialClient pipeline row.
#   4. Upserts the user's Application row for this job, with
#      status="applied", applied_at=now, and the three snapshot columns
#      populated so the Applications page can show "what we sent".
#
# The state machine in applications.py VALID_TRANSITIONS doesn't list a
# direct `None -> applied` transition — that's intentional for PATCH
# /applications/{id}, which represents a user editing an existing app.
# This endpoint bypasses the state machine because it's a CREATE path:
# there's no "current state" to transition from.
