"""Answer book management endpoints.

Regression finding 80: `POST /answer-book` and `PATCH /answer-book/{id}`
previously declared `body: dict`. Replaced with explicit Pydantic
`AnswerCreate` / `AnswerUpdate` schemas which cap `question` at 2 KB
and `answer` at 8 KB (matching the `_LONG_TEXT_MAX` used elsewhere),
enforce the category allowlist at parse time, and remove `source`
from the input surface entirely — the server always sets it based on
the endpoint, eliminating the provenance-spoofing footgun.

      * Resume upload (``resume.py:upload_resume``) — auto-populates on
        first ingest so a brand-new user doesn't have to click a button.
      * Resume switch (``resume.py:switch_active_resume``) — backfills

      * The optional ``/answer-book/import-from-resume`` manual endpoint

    base entry (resume_id IS NULL) with the same normalized question_key.
    Presence wins — we don't overwrite an answer the user may have edited
    by hand. Only adds rows; never updates or deletes. Idempotent: calling
    twice on the same resume is a no-op on the second call.

    Does NOT commit — the caller's transaction owns the commit lifecycle,

    happens inside to propagate FK constraints, but the final commit is
    the caller's.

    Regression finding 172: `resume_id` was previously silently dropped
    by FastAPI (the handler never declared it), so the frontend's
    `?resume_id=X` calls returned the same response as the no-param
    call — always merging base + user.active_resume_id. When a user
    wanted to review overrides for a non-active resume (e.g. while
    switching resumes, or in the resume-comparison flow), they had no
    way to get them.

    F236 regression fix: add the canonical pagination envelope
    (``{items, total, page, page_size, total_pages}``) plus a free-
    text ``q`` filter to match the shape used by ``/feedback``,
    ``/jobs``, ``/applications``. ``categories`` and ``active_resume_id``
    stay at the top level for backward compatibility with the
    AnswerBookPage UI — both fields are envelope-sidecar, not
    per-page metadata.

    Contract:
      - ``resume_id`` omitted  → base + user.active_resume_id overrides
        (unchanged, backward-compatible default)
      - ``resume_id`` provided → base + that resume's overrides, after
        verifying the caller owns the resume (404 otherwise — match
        the existing pattern on `create_answer`)
      - ``category`` and ``q`` filters run BEFORE the resume-override
        merge; pagination happens AFTER, counting merged rows — so a
