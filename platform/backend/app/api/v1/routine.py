"""Claude Routine Apply — orchestration endpoints.

This router is the control-plane for the MCP-Chrome routine that
automates job applications. The routine (a Claude-driven browser
session) polls these endpoints to know:

  * Which jobs to target next                  (top-to-apply)
  * Whether the operator has killed the run    (kill-switch)
  * How to record a run's progress             (runs CRUD)
  * How to de-fingerprint generated text       (humanize helper)

Everything here is *operator-scoped* — a query returns only data
owned by the caller. There are no admin-override endpoints; the
routine runs as the user, and the user sees only their own runs.

Pre-flight gating
-----------------
``POST /routine/runs`` is the single choke-point that decides
whether a run is allowed to start. It verifies:

  1. Kill-switch is OFF.
  2. Required answer-book coverage is 100% complete.
  3. Global daily cap (10 apps / 24h rolling) not hit.

The routine is expected to re-check these between applications too,
because a long run can race against a user toggling the kill-switch.
``GET /routine/top-to-apply`` returns the current state of all three
in its response envelope so a single poll is enough.
