"""Shared Playwright/Chromium service for both scraping and form-filling.

Why this exists
---------------
Two distinct surfaces in the codebase need a real browser:

1. **Scraping** ATS / company sites that block plain ``httpx`` —
   Wellfound is the current motivating case (DataDome bot detection
   returns 403 to every header set we've tried). Playwright with a
   real Chromium fingerprint passes most JS-challenge gates that
   defeat header-only HTTP clients.

2. **Job application workflows** (the v6 "Apply Routine" feature) —
   submitting Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby applications often requires
   filling forms, uploading resumes, clicking buttons, and waiting
   for redirects. Each ATS has its own DOM. Maintaining one
   browser-automation primitive set keeps that growth manageable.

Goals
-----
- **Lazy launch**: don't pay the Chromium startup cost (~2s) until
  the first caller actually needs it. Idle workers / API requests
  that don't touch the browser have zero overhead.
- **Process-wide reuse**: launch one ``Browser`` per Python process
  and share it across sessions. Each session opens its own
  ``BrowserContext`` (cookie-isolated) + ``Page``.
- **Stealth-by-default**: realistic UA, viewport, no
  ``navigator.webdriver``. Caller can opt into stronger stealth via
  ``playwright-stealth`` if that package is installed (we don't
  hard-require it — the dependency footprint is large and version-
  flaky against new Chromium releases).
- **Two ergonomic API levels**:
  * ``fetch_html(url, ...)`` — one-call shortcut for the common
    "load page, wait for it, return rendered HTML" pattern.
  * ``BrowserSession`` context manager — for multi-step workflows
    (navigate → fill → click → wait → submit) where the page
    needs to persist between operations.
- **Testable**: every method has a sync seam so unit tests can mock
  the browser without spinning up Chromium.

Operational discipline
----------------------
- Per-session ``BrowserContext`` so cookies / localStorage / auth
  state never leak between unrelated workflows.
- Hard wall-clock timeouts on every navigation + selector wait so a
  hung page can't pin a Celery worker.
- Screenshot-on-failure goes to ``/tmp/playwright-fail-<uuid>.png``
  when ``PLAYWRIGHT_DEBUG_SCREENSHOTS=1`` — admins can grab them
  via SSH when an apply workflow regresses against a new ATS UI.
- Graceful shutdown via FastAPI lifespan so the Chromium process
  closes cleanly on container rotation.

Not in scope
------------
- Solving CAPTCHA (hCaptcha / reCAPTCHA / Turnstile). DataDome
  occasionally throws those; this module logs + returns failure.
- Persistent login state across container restarts. The current
  apply flows are one-shot; if a future workflow needs sticky
  sessions, add ``user_data_dir`` plumbing here.
