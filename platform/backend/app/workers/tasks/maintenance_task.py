# F272 — scan_logs retention. Manual integrity audit found the
# scan_logs table at 252k rows with no cleanup task wired up. The
# table grows ~13k rows/day (16 platforms × ~800 scans/day) so at
# current rate the row count doubles every ~20 days unbounded.
# Concrete impact today is small (~38MB on disk, queries still
# fast on the started_at btree index), but at 1M+ rows the
# /monitoring activity_24h aggregate query starts paying real cost.
# Better to add the prune task now than firefight at 5M rows later.
#
# Retention window: 60 days. Rationale:
#   * /monitoring activity_24h only looks at last 24h — 60 days is
#     vastly beyond what's queried.
#   * /platforms last_scan / total_errors aggregations look at
#     "most recent" or "last 24h" — same reasoning.
#   * Debug cases occasionally need to look at "what happened a
#     month ago when scans started failing" — 60 days covers two
#     months of cycles which is a reasonable forensic window.
#   * If the team needs longer retention later, bump the constant
#     and re-deploy; the historical rows are compacted in postgres
#     so re-shrinking is fast.

    resume scorer's online raw_json fallback (F97) covers this at
    scoring time, but every read path that joins JobDescription
    (``/jobs/{id}/description``, the JD-text-only ATS test harness)
    sees empty rows. This task walks the gap once: for every Job
    whose ``raw_json`` is non-null and whose ``id`` doesn't appear in
    ``job_descriptions``, parse the raw_json via the same
    ``extract_description`` helper the scan pipeline uses and merge
    a JobDescription row.

    Idempotent — re-runs are safe because the WHERE clause filters
    out anything that already has a row. Batched to keep a single
    transaction's write set bounded (``batch_size`` jobs per
    commit). ``max_jobs`` lets ops cap a one-shot run for a smoke
    test before unleashing the full sweep.

    Returns ``{"backfilled": int, "skipped_no_text": int, "scanned": int}``
    so admins can see what landed and what couldn't be backfilled
    (raw_json present but extractor returned empty — usually means
    the platform mapping in ``extract_description`` doesn't cover
    that row's shape, which is a separate finding).
