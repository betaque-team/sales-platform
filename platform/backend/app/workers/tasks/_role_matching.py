# like "We have offices in France and a remote team in Spain" don't

    """Match a role using DB config with a hardcoded-list safety net.

    F235 regression fix — the DB ``RoleClusterConfig`` rows are seeded
    once and drift as the hardcoded ``INFRA_KEYWORDS`` /
    ``SECURITY_KEYWORDS`` lists get refined each regression round
    (F91, F92, F93, F227, …). Pre-fix, ``match_role_from_config`` was
    effectively a strict SUBSET of ``match_role``, so every
    ``reclassify_and_rescore`` run under-classified hundreds of titles
    that the hardcoded matcher would have caught (tester observed
    315 stale infra + 440 stale security rows after a full sweep).

    Strategy:

    1. Run the config-driven matcher first. If it lands on a
       non-empty cluster, trust it — admins explicitly configured
       the cluster and any custom clusters (e.g. "data_science")
       only exist on that side.
    2. If the config-driven matcher came back empty *and* the config
       has an active cluster for infra/security/qa, fall back to
       the hardcoded matcher for that same built-in cluster. The
       fallback only fires when (a) config has the cluster defined
       and (b) config matcher produced no answer, so we can never
       resurrect a cluster the admin explicitly disabled.
    3. If no config is supplied, run the hardcoded matcher directly
       (the legacy single-matcher path used by callers that haven't
       loaded the cluster config yet).

    Net effect: config wins when it has an opinion; the hardcoded
    superset catches what the DB config narrows off; disabled clusters
    are still respected.
