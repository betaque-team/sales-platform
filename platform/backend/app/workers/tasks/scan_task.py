    Called from `_scan_board` after a successful fetcher call (the
    fetcher-raised path never reaches us — it rollbacks via the outer
    except). Mutates `board` in place; the caller is responsible for
    committing. No return value — the helper is a pure state machine
    over the three cases below.

    Cases (in the order they're tested):
    1. `jobs_found >= 1`: board is alive. Reset the counter to 0 and,
       as defense-in-depth, clear any prior auto-deactivation reason
       in case an admin manually reactivated and the board has come
       back to life on its own.
    2. `errors > 0` with `jobs_found == 0`: cannot happen in practice
       today — per-job errors only fire inside the `for raw_job`
       loop, which only runs when `jobs_found >= 1`. But the guard
       is cheap and keeps the "errors don't count" invariant
       explicit for future callers.
    3. `jobs_found == 0` with `errors == 0`: clean zero return.
       Increment the counter and, if we've crossed the threshold
       while still active, flip `is_active=False` and stamp the
       reason. The `board.is_active` check makes this idempotent —
