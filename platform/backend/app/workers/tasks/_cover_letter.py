# Regression finding 235: cover letters were leaking obvious AI tells —
# specifically em-dashes (— and the en-dash variant –), which Claude
# uses heavily by default and which most human writers don't. The
# strongest defense is a hard prompt instruction, but models still
# slip the character through ~5-10% of the time, so we also scrub
# the output as belt-and-suspenders. Replacement: a comma + space,
# which is the closest grammatical equivalent in 95% of em-dash uses
# (the parenthetical-aside case). Standalone em-dash patterns at
# sentence starts get a softer treatment to avoid double-comma noise.

    they never appear. Pre-fix users would refuse to send the
    generated letter because "it looks AI-written"; the dashes were
    the largest tell of that, even more than vocabulary choices.

    Strategy:
    - " — " (spaced em-dash, the most common form Claude emits) → ", "
    - "—word" (no leading space, e.g. mid-sentence appositive) → ", word"
    - bare "—" (rare, usually after parsing artifact) → ", "

CANDIDATE RESUME (this is the only source of factual claims):
{resume_text[:3000]}

TARGET JOB:
Title: {job_title}
Company: {company_name}

JOB DESCRIPTION (use this to choose which resume claims to surface and how to phrase them, not as a source of new claims):
{job_description[:3000] if job_description else "Not available. Write based on the job title and company alone."}

TONE: {tone_instructions.get(tone, tone_instructions["professional"])}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Write a cover letter (250-350 words) tailored specifically to this job.
2. Open with a compelling hook. Do NOT start with "I am writing to apply for..." or any variant.
3. Every factual claim, metric, project, technology, or experience referenced in the cover letter MUST come from the resume above. If the job description mentions a skill or responsibility that isn't backed by the resume, do NOT mention it. If the resume has nothing relevant, write a shorter letter rather than padding with invented claims.
4. Use the job description to decide which resume points to lead with and how to frame them in the company's language. Mirror the job description's vocabulary only when the underlying experience exists in the resume.
5. Show knowledge of the company and why this role is a fit, but only using information available in the job description or company name. Do NOT invent company facts.
6. Include 2-3 concrete achievements or metrics drawn directly from the resume.
7. Close with a confident, specific call to action.
8. Writing style constraints (these are what make the letter read as human-written, not AI-generated):
   - Do NOT use em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) anywhere in the letter. Use commas, parentheses, or two short sentences instead. This is non-negotiable.
   - Do NOT use generic filler phrases like "I am excited to apply", "passionate self-starter", "results-driven professional", "dynamic environment", "leverage my skills", "proven track record".
   - Avoid words that pattern-match as AI output: "delve", "leverage" (as a verb), "tapestry", "robust", "elevate", "navigate", "embark", "realm", "myriad", "showcase".
   - Vary sentence length. Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones.
   - Use specific tools, numbers, and project names from the resume rather than generic descriptions.
