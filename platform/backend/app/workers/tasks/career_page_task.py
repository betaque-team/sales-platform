# Regression finding 151 (CWE-918 SSRF, severity:red): even after F201
# gated career-pages CRUD on admin, any admin can still store a URL
# like `http://127.0.0.1:6379/INFO` or `http://169.254.169.254/...`
# (Oracle IMDS) and the scanner runs from the VPC's network position,
# so the request lands on internal services. Access-control alone
# isn't enough — ops accounts have legitimate reasons to be admin-
# equivalent without SSRF-blast-radius authority. Defense-in-depth
# here blocks the actual network reach: resolve the URL's hostname
# BEFORE issuing the HTTP request, walk every resolved IP (A + AAAA
# records — DNS rebinding can return multiple addresses, some
# public some private), and refuse if any one is in the private-
# or reserved-range set. We also refuse non-http(s) schemes since
# the API validator only guarantees the scheme at create-time and
# legacy rows (F174's 117 non-URL rows) may still trickle through.
