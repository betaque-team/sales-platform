"""Structural tests for the Claude Routine Apply router.

No live DB. We import the router module and inspect its FastAPI
metadata to lock down invariants that determine whether the feature
is safe to ship:

  1. Every route requires authentication. A routine endpoint without
     ``get_current_user`` in its dependency chain would let an
     unauthenticated caller trigger a run on behalf of someone else.

  2. The prefix is ``/routine``. The v6 docs + the frontend api.ts
     both bake this path in; renaming it silently is a breaking
     change we want to notice in CI.

  3. Tunables match the v6 spec. DAILY_CAP, COMPANY_COOLDOWN_DAYS,
     EXCLUDED_PLATFORMS — regression protection for anyone who
     "temporarily bumps" a constant without updating the spec.

  4. The routine accepts every geography bucket the answer_book_seed
     covers with a salary row. If the two drift (e.g. we add a new
     bucket but forget the corresponding salary seed), the routine
     can't fill salary for jobs in the new bucket and the operator
     silently gets a broken run.

End-to-end HTTP + DB coverage is covered by the live integration
harness (tests/test_api.py script-mode), not here.
