"""Structural tests for F262 — Celery OOM hardening.

No live DB / no celery worker. We assert the invariants that prove
the OOM fix is wired correctly:

  1. Heavy batch tasks (``rescore_jobs``, ``reclassify_and_rescore``)
     are routed to the ``heavy`` queue. A regression where someone
     drops the route would put them back on the default queue, where
     the 1.5GB worker would OOM during the chunked run (each chunk
     allocates ~50MB; under load the default worker shouldn't be
     juggling that AND scan tasks).

  2. The chunked-iteration code in ``rescore_jobs`` doesn't call
     ``select(Job).all()`` on the unbounded set. We can't easily run
     the task without a real DB, but we CAN inspect its source for
     the patterns we care about (presence of LIMIT/keyset paging,
     presence of ``expire_all()``).

  3. The default queue and heavy queue routes don't overlap — every
     task with an explicit route goes to exactly one queue.

End-to-end memory profiling under load is covered by the deploy-time
verification (run the task, watch ``docker stats`` for flat memory).
