# Regression Test Report — salesplatform.reventlabs.com

**Date:** 2026-04-15
**Tester:** automated (Claude + local Chrome)
**Branch:** `main` (up-to-date with `origin/main`; pulled `ea0de3c..6e9c76e` before testing)
**Environment:** Production — https://salesplatform.reventlabs.com

## How we track fixes

This file is the shared source of truth between the tester and the bug fixer.
Both write to the **same branch** so the findings list and fix status stay in
one place.

**Workflow (both tester and fixer):**

1. Always work on branch `fix/regression-findings` — **never** push directly to `main`.
2. Before editing this file, pull the latest so you don't clobber each other:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout fix/regression-findings
   git pull --rebase origin fix/regression-findings
   ```
3. **Tester** appends new rows to the findings table at the bottom (next number
   in sequence) with `Fix Status = ⬜ open`, describes the finding in a new
   section below, then commits + pushes:
   ```bash
   git add REGRESSION_TEST_REPORT.md
   git commit -m "Add regression finding #N: <short title>"
   git push origin fix/regression-findings
   ```
4. **Fixer** (Claude) picks up open findings, implements the fix, updates the
   row's `Fix Status` to ✅ (with a one-line summary of the fix), commits + pushes.
5. When all findings are ✅ (or deliberately punted to a follow-up ticket), open a
   single PR `fix/regression-findings → main`.

**Fix Status key:** ✅ fixed · 🟡 partial · ⏳ investigating · ⬜ open

## Credentials Used

| Role | Email | Auth | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| super_admin | sarthak.gupta@reventlabs.com | Google SSO | Not tested (requires interactive OAuth) |
| admin | test-admin@reventlabs.com | Password `TestAdmin123` | ✅ Works |
| reviewer | test-reviewer@reventlabs.com | Password `TestReview123` | ✅ Works after running `python -m app.seed_test_users` on backend |
| viewer | test-viewer@reventlabs.com | Password `TestView123` | ✅ Works after running `python -m app.seed_test_users` on backend |

## Severity Legend
- 🔴 **BLOCKER** — critical flow broken, data wrong, or security issue
- 🟠 **HIGH** — feature unusable or user-impacting bug
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** — noticeable but workaround exists
- 🔵 **LOW** — cosmetic / polish

---

## 1. Summary of Key Findings

| # | Severity | Area | Finding | Fix Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 | Auth | `test-reviewer` & `test-viewer` credentials from password doc both return 401 — roles cannot be tested end-to-end | ✅ fixed: new `app/seed_test_users.py` script (modelled on `seed_admin.py`) upserts reviewer + viewer users with known passwords. Run on prod: `docker compose exec backend python -m app.seed_test_users`. Creds: `test-reviewer@reventlabs.com / TestReview123`, `test-viewer@reventlabs.com / TestView123` |
| 2 | 🔴 | Data integrity | Company count inconsistent: Dashboard says **5,827**, Companies page & Monitoring say **6,638** | ✅ fixed: Dashboard now uses `COUNT(Company.id)` to match Monitoring (`analytics.py`) |
| 3 | 🟠 | Jobs/UX | Clicking a checkbox on a job row navigates to the job detail (missing `stopPropagation`) — bulk-select effectively unusable | ✅ fixed: removed double-toggle, added explicit `stopPropagation` on input + cell (`JobsPage.tsx`) |
| 4 | 🟠 | Search | Search by company name returns 0 results for real companies (e.g. `Bitwarden` → 0, but Bitwarden jobs appear on dashboard). Confirms an existing user ticket | ✅ fixed: `jobs.py` search now matches `Job.title`, `Company.name`, and `Job.location_raw` |
| 5 | 🟠 | Admin UX | `/users` page returns empty state for non-super_admin. API returns 403 but UI shows "0 admins, 0 reviewers, 0 viewers" with no permission notice | ✅ fixed: `UserManagementPage.tsx` renders a proper permission-denied card on 403 |
| 6 | 🟡 | Analytics | Job Trends chart axis labels render `NaN/NaN` (multiple times) | ✅ fixed: `dataKey` was `date`/`new_jobs` but backend returns `day`/`total`; added aliases + guarded `tickFormatter` |
| 7 | 🟡 | Platforms | `himalayas` fetcher reports **180 errors** on last scan; 4 platforms (`bamboohr`, `jobvite`, `recruitee`, `wellfound`) report 0 jobs but are marked active | 🟡 partial: (a) `BaseFetcher` now sends a Chrome User-Agent so light bot-detection lets us through; (b) `bamboohr.py` + `jobvite.py` now detect the redirect to their marketing site and return `[]` cleanly (was spamming "non-JSON" warnings — boards in the DB are stale slugs); (c) `wellfound.py` logs 403 as "Cloudflare block" instead of a generic HTTP error; (d) `scan_task.py` aggregator-company upsert now uses a SAVEPOINT so a dup-slug race no longer rolls back 200+ jobs of in-flight upserts — this is the real cause of himalayas's 180 errors. Still open: Wellfound is genuinely Cloudflare-blocked (needs browser/auth), and the BambooHR/Jobvite/Recruitee boards in the DB should be auto-deactivated after N consecutive 0-job scans (ops follow-up) |
| 8 | 🟡 | Sidebar | `Settings` link lives inside `adminNavigation` (Sidebar.tsx:47-51) — reviewers/viewers can't reach their own Settings via the nav | ✅ fixed: moved `Settings` into the shared `navigation` list in `Sidebar.tsx` |
| 9 | 🔵 | Dashboard | "1864 jobs" badge on Security section wraps onto 2 lines at 1728px viewport | ✅ fixed: `Badge` now uses `whitespace-nowrap` + `shrink-0` so it never wraps |
| 10 | 🔵 | Pipeline | A card titled literally "1name" appears in `Researching` stage — looks like seeded/test data leaking to prod | ⬜ open — data cleanup task, not code. Run `DELETE FROM potential_clients WHERE company_name ILIKE '1name'` against prod (with admin approval) |
| 11 | 🔵 | Feedback | Many duplicate "Resume Score / Relevance" tickets (8 identical entries from same user 4/14) — no dedup | ✅ fixed: `feedback.py` now returns 409 if the same user posts an identical open title within 7 days |
| 12 | 🔵 | Copy | Dashboard AI Insight says "6 ATS sources" when 10 are listed on Platforms | ✅ fixed: analytics fallback now uses `COUNT(DISTINCT platform)` instead of `len(top_sources)` |
| 13 | 🟠 | Pipeline API | `PATCH /api/v1/pipeline/{id}` accepts any string as `stage` — no validation against known stage keys; cards can be orphaned into non-existent stages | ✅ fixed: `pipeline.py` PATCH endpoint now validates `body.stage` against `_get_stage_keys(db)` (same check POST already had) and returns 400 with the allowed-stages list if invalid |
| 14 | 🟡 | Resume upload | File content not validated; plain-text renamed `.pdf` and empty 0-byte files are accepted (200 OK) and persisted with `status:"error"`, cluttering the DB | ✅ fixed: `resume.py` upload now (a) rejects empty / <256-byte files, (b) verifies magic bytes (`%PDF-` for PDF, `PK\x03\x04` for DOCX) so renamed plain-text bounces with 400, (c) rejects with 400 when extracted text < 50 words instead of persisting `status:"error"` rows |
| 15 | 🟡 | Pipeline API | `PATCH /api/v1/pipeline/{id}` accepts unbounded `priority` (tested 999999999 and -100) and `notes` (tested 100 KB) — no length / range limits | ⬜ open |
| 16 | 🟠 | Feedback API | `GET /api/v1/feedback/{id}` with a non-UUID path returns **500** instead of 422 — path param is declared `str` rather than `UUID` | ⬜ open |
| 17 | 🟡 | Platforms | `himalayas.py` hard-caps pagination at ~1020 jobs (`offset > 1000` break); repeated scans return identical `jobs_found: 1020` with varying `new_jobs`, implying the catalog exceeds the cap | ⬜ open |
| 18 | 🟡 | Search / Data | `Stripe` company shows `job_count: 61` but `/jobs?search=Stripe` returns only 3 (title matches). Finding #4 fix is in `212830a` but may not be deployed, or `Job.company.has()` isn't surfacing all rows | ⬜ open |
| 19 | 🔵 | Security headers | Response headers missing `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Permissions-Policy`, Cross-Origin policies. Cookie flags are good (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=lax`) | ⬜ open |
| 20 | 🔵 | Role Clusters | `POST /api/v1/role-clusters` accepts arbitrary punctuation/special-chars in `name` (stored lowercased); no `[a-z0-9_-]+` sanitization. Safe vs. SQLi (ORM), but `name` is used as URL param downstream | ⬜ open |

---

## 2. UI / UX

### 2.1 Navigation & Layout
- ✅ Sidebar renders all pages for `admin`: Dashboard, Relevant Jobs, All Jobs, Review Queue, Companies, Platforms, Resume Score, Answer Book, Credentials, Applications, Pipeline, Analytics, Intelligence, Feedback, Docs.
- ✅ Admin section correctly renders Monitoring, Role Clusters, Settings.
- ✅ Sidebar source hides `User Management` behind `role === "super_admin"` check, matching spec.
- 🟡 **Finding 8**: `Settings` is declared in `adminNavigation` array. Reviewers & viewers still have `/settings` as an open route but lack the sidebar entry — inconsistent.
- 🔵 **Finding 9**: On Dashboard, the `1864 jobs` counter in the Security column header wraps to 2 lines at 1728×855 because of the long section title. Cosmetic, fixable with truncation or smaller badge.

### 2.2 Forms & Inputs
- ✅ Login form: email validation via HTML5 `type=email`; server responds `422` for invalid format, `401` for bad credentials.
- ✅ Password reset request returns a generic "If the email exists…" response regardless of existence (good — no email enumeration).
- 🟠 **Finding 3**: On `/jobs`, each row has an `onClick` to navigate to job detail. The checkbox inside the row doesn't stop propagation, so clicking the checkbox navigates instead of selecting. Bulk actions documented in `/docs` cannot be performed from the UI.

### 2.3 Pagination
- ✅ Companies (133 pages), Jobs (multi-page), Feedback (2 pages) all render Prev / Next / numbered controls.

### 2.4 Filters & Sort (Jobs page)
- ✅ Platform filter works (`greenhouse` → 13,087; matches Monitoring).
- ✅ `role_cluster=security` returns 1,864 jobs, matching the dashboard badge — consistent.
- ✅ Status, Geography, Role, Sort dropdowns all render with full option sets.
- 🟠 **Finding 4**: Search box is labelled "Search jobs by title **or company**" but company search is broken — `Bitwarden` → 0 results even though Bitwarden jobs appear on the Dashboard. `Stripe` → 3 (plausible but suspicious given the 10+ Stripe jobs visible on Dashboard recent list). Title search works (e.g. `Senior Security Engineer` → 48).

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Authentication
| Scenario | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| Valid admin creds | 200 + cookie | ✅ 200, `/me` returns `role: "admin"` |
| Reviewer creds from cred sheet | 200 | ❌ **401** `Invalid email or password` |
| Viewer creds from cred sheet | 200 | ❌ **401** `Invalid email or password` |
| Bogus creds | 401 | ✅ 401 `Invalid email or password` |
| Invalid email format | 422 | ✅ 422 pydantic validation |
| Reset-password request (unknown email) | 200 generic | ✅ 200 `If the email exists…` — no enumeration |
| Wrong reset-password path (`/password-reset-request`) | 404 | ✅ 404 (endpoint lives at `/reset-password/request`) |

Observation: rate limiting is aggressive — several consecutive bad logins flipped to `503` for ~10s. Good for abuse resistance but was intermittently hit during normal retesting.

### 3.2 Jobs
- ✅ `/api/v1/jobs` pagination returns `{ items, total }`, total = 47,072, matches Monitoring.
- ✅ Job detail page: title, company, platform, status, score breakdown (Title 40%, Company 20%, Geo 20%, Source 10%, Freshness 10%), Quick Actions (Accept/Reject), AI Tools (Cover Letter, Interview Prep), Review Comment/Tags, Review History.
- ✅ Readiness checks on detail: "No active resume", "No credentials for greenhouse", "No answers yet" before `Apply` is enabled.
- 🟠 Finding 3 (bulk-select) documented above.
- 🟠 Finding 4 (company search) documented above.

### 3.3 Review Queue
- ✅ Shows "20 jobs awaiting review" with cursor `1 of 20`.
- ✅ Rejection tag chips: Location, Seniority, Not Relevant, Salary, Company, Duplicate.
- ✅ Skip advances counter (1 of 20 → 2 of 20).
- ⚠️ Accept / Reject not exercised to avoid mutating production data.

### 3.4 Companies
- ✅ 6,638 companies tracked; filters for Target / Has Contacts / Actively Hiring / Recently Funded; funding-stage chips; 3 sort modes.
- ✅ Company detail loads with Overview, Hiring Velocity, Open Roles, Enrich Now button, Hiring Locations, Key People table, ATS Boards.
- ✅ For enriched companies (e.g. 1Password, enriched 4/6/2026) the Key People table renders 11 C-suite contacts with outreach status pills (Not contacted / Emailed / Replied / Meeting scheduled / Not interested).
- 🟡 Even enriched companies show `--` for Industry, Size, Founded, Headquarters, Funding and all contact emails — fields are blank. Suggests enrichment is only populating names/titles.

### 3.5 Pipeline
- ✅ Kanban board with stages: New Lead (9), Researching (1), Qualified (0), Outreach (0), Engaged (0), Disqualified (0).
- ✅ Each card shows open roles, priority, accepted/total, last job date, created date.
- ✅ `Add Stage` button visible for admins.
- 🔵 **Finding 10**: Card titled "1name" in Researching stage — almost certainly test data.

### 3.6 Platforms
- ✅ All 14 configured platforms listed with active/total boards, total jobs, accepted, avg score, last-scan time.
- 🟡 **Finding 7**: Stats show `himalayas` 1/1 active + **180 errors** on last scan; `bamboohr 5/5 active → 0 jobs`; `jobvite 5/5 active → 0 jobs`; `recruitee 8/8 active → 0 jobs`; `wellfound 10/10 active → 0 jobs`. Either boards are broken fetchers or those platforms have no relevant openings, but `0 jobs` across a full active roster usually indicates a scraping failure.
- ✅ Scan logs are exposed per platform.

### 3.7 Analytics
- ✅ 7d / 30d / 90d range toggle.
- ✅ Totals: 47,072 jobs, 9 accepted, 1 rejected, 90.0% acceptance rate, avg score 40.
- ✅ Acceptance by Platform table: himalayas 100%, lever 100%, weworkremotely 100%, greenhouse 80%.
- 🟡 **Finding 6**: `Job Trends (30d)` chart shows `NaN/NaN` six times where axis tick labels should be. Likely date math on an empty/`undefined` series.
- 🟡 `Source Distribution` chart and `Pipeline Funnel` chart render but with mostly empty data; Applications Funnel shows "No platform data available".

### 3.8 Resume Score
- ✅ Upload UI (PDF/DOCX, max 5MB).
- ✅ "No resumes uploaded yet" empty state.
- ⚠️ End-to-end upload+score not exercised (requires producing a resume; avoided side-effects on production DB).

### 3.9 Applications
- ✅ Status tabs render: All / Prepared / Submitted / Applied / Interview / Offer / Rejected / Withdrawn.
- ✅ "No applications found" empty state for fresh test account.

### 3.10 Answer Book
- ✅ 13 entries, category tabs (Personal Info 0/5, Work Authorization 0/0, Experience 0/1, Skills 0/0, Preferences 0/0, Custom 0/7).
- ✅ Entries discovered via `ats_discovered` source (e.g. visa sponsorship, target compensation, time-zone confirmation).

### 3.11 Credentials
- ✅ "No active resume selected" guard — correctly prevents credential management without persona.

### 3.12 Intelligence
- ✅ Tabs: Skill Gaps, Salary Intel, Timing, Networking. Role cluster filter (All / Infra / Security / QA).
- ✅ Empty state prompts to upload a resume before showing skills coverage. Good UX.

### 3.13 Feedback (Tickets)
- ✅ 27 tickets total (16 Open, 0 In Progress, 6 Resolved), category & status filters, pagination (2 pages).
- 🔵 **Finding 11**: 8+ identical "Resume Score / Relevance" tickets from `Khushi Jain` on 4/14. Needs dedup or a "known issue" pin.
- ℹ️ Several existing tickets already overlap with bugs I found (see Finding 4 — "Search Bar" ticket from Khushi Jain: "Bitwarden exists in All Jobs section, but when I search it on searching bar, the interface shows 'No Jobs Found.'").

### 3.14 Docs
- ✅ Loads as a guided playbook (First-Time Setup → Daily Workflow → Reference). No broken sections observed.

### 3.15 Settings (self)
- ✅ Profile block (Name `Test Admin`, Email, Role `admin`, Member Since `April 10, 2026`).
- ✅ `Change Password` CTA.
- ✅ `Job Alerts` section with "Add Alert" and empty state referencing Google Chat notifications.

---

## 4. Admin Features

### 4.1 Monitoring
- ✅ System header: "All systems operational", Uptime 26m.
- ✅ Scan Controls: Full Platform Scan + Discover New Platforms.
- ✅ Per-platform scan tiles (with Run button) for 14 platforms.
- ✅ DB section: 343.1 MB total, per-table sizes (jobs 273 MB, scan_logs 32.8 MB, …).
- ✅ Activity (24h): Scans 1742, new jobs 2403, errors 0, last scan @ 1:49 PM greenhouse/dell.
- ✅ Breakdown charts: Role Cluster (unclassified 90%, infra 5%, security 4%, qa 1%), Geography (70.2% unclassified, 26.5% usa_only, 2.9% global_remote, 0.4% uae_only), Platform (himalayas 33.7%, greenhouse 27.8%, lever 25.7%, …), Status (new 99.9%, under_review 0.1%, accepted 9, rejected 1).
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 30s.

### 4.2 Role Clusters
- ✅ Three clusters render: `infra`, `qa`, `security` — all marked Relevant. Keywords + Roles expand correctly ("+19 more", "+16 more", etc.).
- ℹ️ Matches `CLAUDE.md` default of infra+security plus an added `qa` cluster.

### 4.3 User Management (`/users`)
- 🟠 **Finding 5**: Admin (non-super_admin) gets `403` from `GET /api/v1/users` and UI silently renders:
  `admins 0 · reviewers 0 · viewers 0` with empty table. Should render a permission-denied state instead of zeros, or the nav item should also be gated to `super_admin` only (it is in the sidebar source, but the route itself is reachable by URL).

---

## 5. Data Validations

### 5.1 Count Consistency
| Source | Count |
|---|---|
| Dashboard "Companies" widget | **5,827** |
| Monitoring "Companies" | **6,638** |
| `/companies` "… companies tracked" | **6,638** |
| Dashboard "Total Jobs" | 47,072 |
| Monitoring "Total Jobs" | 47,072 |
| `/jobs` total | 47,072 |

- 🔴 **Finding 2**: Dashboard under-counts companies by 811. Likely two different queries (Dashboard excluding something like 0-jobs companies, Monitoring counting all).

### 5.2 Role-Cluster Cross-check
- Dashboard shows: infra 2,357 · security 1,864 · qa 506 · global_remote 1,366 · relevant 4,727.
- 2,357 + 1,864 + 506 = 4,727 ✅ matches "Relevant" total.
- Monitoring: `unclassified 42,345 + infra 2,357 + security 1,864 + qa 506 = 47,072` ✅.

### 5.3 Acceptance Counts
- Dashboard `Accepted 9`. Monitoring `accepted 9`. Analytics `accepted 9`. Consistent. ✅

### 5.4 Input Validation
- ✅ Login: invalid email format → 422 pydantic.
- ✅ Login: empty password → validation error.
- ✅ Reset-password request: unknown email → 200 generic (no enumeration).
- ⚠️ Did not test: minimum password length on password-change, resume MIME/size enforcement, tag length limits in Review Queue.

---

## 6. E2E Flows Exercised

| Flow | Result |
|---|---|
| Login → Dashboard | ✅ |
| Dashboard → Jobs → filter by `role_cluster=security` → count matches Dashboard (1,864) | ✅ |
| Jobs → row click → Job Detail → score breakdown visible | ✅ |
| Jobs → checkbox click | ❌ navigates instead of selecting (Finding 3) |
| Review Queue → Skip → advances 1 of 20 → 2 of 20 | ✅ |
| Companies → row click → Company Detail → Key People table (1Password: 11 contacts) | ✅ |
| Admin → Monitoring → scan stats, breakdowns, auto-refresh | ✅ |
| Admin → Role Clusters → list 3 clusters | ✅ |
| Admin → Users → **403 hidden behind empty state** | ❌ (Finding 5) |
| Logout → back to /login | ✅ (via Sign Out click) |
| Login as reviewer | ❌ 401 (Finding 1) |
| Login as viewer | ❌ 401 (Finding 1) |

---

## 7. Role-Based Access Control (partial — credentials blocker)

### 7.1 Admin (test-admin)
- Sees `Admin` sidebar group (Monitoring, Role Clusters, Settings).
- Does NOT see `User Management` in sidebar (correctly gated to super_admin in code).
- Direct navigation to `/users` is still possible and renders a misleading empty state instead of a 403 error page.

### 7.2 Reviewer / Viewer
- Could NOT be tested because the provided credentials (`TestReview123`, `TestView123`) return 401. Needs either:
  1. Verified/resent passwords for the test accounts, or
  2. Admin-triggered password reset to a known value.

### 7.3 Code-level observations
- `Sidebar.tsx:104` gates Admin nav to `admin | super_admin`. OK.
- `Sidebar.tsx:128` gates User Mgmt nav to `super_admin`. OK.
- `App.tsx` routes are all `ProtectedRoute`-wrapped but with no per-role check, so direct URL access to admin pages relies entirely on the backend to reject requests. Pages (e.g. `/users`, `/role-clusters`) should also render permission-denied UI when the API 403s.

---

## 8. Misc Observations
- `reventlabs` text badge in top-left reads as lowercase next to the Sales Platform heading — intentional?
- Backend uptime was `26m` at start of testing — platform was restarted recently.
- Dashboard AI Insights says "Platform has 47,072 jobs indexed across **6 ATS sources**" but Platforms page lists jobs on **10 sources** (greenhouse, lever, ashby, workable, himalayas, smartrecruiters, weworkremotely, remoteok, remotive, linkedin). Minor copy inaccuracy.
- Rate limiting on `/api/v1/auth/login` flipped to `503` after ~5 rapid attempts; returned to normal after ~10s. Confirmed again with fresh attempt.

---

## 9. Areas NOT Exercised (recommend adding to next round)
- Resume upload + scoring (requires a real PDF; avoided prod-side effects).
- AI resume customization (Anthropic-backed; costs tokens).
- Password change flow.
- Accept / Reject in Review Queue (state-mutating on real tickets).
- Pipeline drag-drop between stages.
- Company Enrichment trigger (long-running Celery job).
- Full-platform Scan + Discovery triggers (heavy background work).
- Google SSO login for `sarthak.gupta@reventlabs.com`.
- Frontend responsive behaviour below 1024px.
- Screen-reader / keyboard-nav accessibility.
- CSRF / cookie flags (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).

---

## 10. Bug Tickets Suggested (one-liner each)
1. Reviewer/Viewer test credentials on the credential sheet don't match the DB — block for QA.
2. Dashboard Companies count (5,827) disagrees with Monitoring/Companies page (6,638).
3. Jobs bulk-select: checkbox click opens detail. Add `stopPropagation` on `<td>` containing the checkbox.
4. Jobs search by company name returns 0 for real companies (`Bitwarden`). Align title+company search.
5. `/users` page for non-super_admin: show permission-denied state instead of `0 / 0 / 0` empty counts.
6. Analytics Job Trends chart: axis labels show `NaN/NaN`.
7. Platforms: `himalayas` 180 errors; bamboohr/jobvite/recruitee/wellfound report 0 jobs despite being active.
8. Sidebar: move `Settings` out of `adminNavigation` so reviewers/viewers can see their own Settings entry.
9. Dashboard Security column: `1864 jobs` badge wraps on 2 lines.
10. Pipeline: "1name" test card in Researching.
11. Feedback: dedup 8+ identical Resume Score / Relevance tickets.
12. Dashboard AI Insight: "6 ATS sources" should be "10" based on Platforms data.

---

## 11. Round 2 Findings (2026-04-15, same-day deep retest)

Added after the fixer landed `212830a` (findings 2–6, 8–9, 11–12) and `6205733`
(finding 1 seed script). Probes run from an authenticated `test-admin` session.
All side-effects were reverted (bad pipeline stage, test uploads deleted, probe
role-cluster deleted).

### 13. Pipeline stage PATCH accepts arbitrary strings
**Severity:** 🟠 HIGH · **Area:** `PATCH /api/v1/pipeline/{client_id}` (`backend/app/api/v1/pipeline.py:347`)

Reproduced:
```js
fetch('/api/v1/pipeline/73617d28-a631-46d5-bc45-934c9b135cfc', {
  method: 'PATCH', credentials: 'include',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({stage: 'TOTALLY_FAKE_STAGE_XYZ_REGRESSION'})
})
// → 200 OK; card.stage == "TOTALLY_FAKE_STAGE_XYZ_REGRESSION"
```

Expected: **400 Bad Request** with `"Invalid stage. Must be one of: new_lead, researching, qualified, outreach, engaged, disqualified"` — exactly what `POST /api/v1/pipeline` already does via `_get_stage_keys(db)` at `pipeline.py:310-312`.

**Fix:** mirror the same check inside `update_client` — before assigning `client.stage = body.stage`, verify `body.stage in await _get_stage_keys(db)`; else raise `HTTPException(400, …)`.

The probe card was PATCHed back to `researching` immediately after testing.

---

### 14. Resume upload does not validate file content
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM · **Area:** `POST /api/v1/resume/upload`

1. Plain-text body with `.pdf` extension and fake `application/pdf` MIME:
   ```js
   const fd = new FormData();
   fd.append('file', new Blob(['just plain text'], {type: 'application/pdf'}), 'spoofed.pdf');
   fetch('/api/v1/resume/upload', {method: 'POST', body: fd, credentials: 'include'})
   // → 200 OK; resume persisted: word_count: 0, status: "error", is_active: false
   ```

2. Empty 0-byte file (`new Blob([''], {type: 'application/pdf'})`) — same 200 OK, persisted.

3. ✅ Oversized (6 MB padded `%PDF` header): correctly rejected with 400 "File size exceeds 5MB limit".

Both garbage records were deleted via `DELETE /api/v1/resume/{id}` → 200 OK.

**Impact:** pollutes `resume` table with unusable entries that still appear in the user's resume list UI. User has to manually delete or IT has to clean.

**Fix:** after saving, attempt `PyPDF2.PdfReader(io.BytesIO(raw))` / `docx.Document(io.BytesIO(raw))`; if it throws, return 400 before commit. Also reject 0-byte files at the boundary (`UploadFile.size == 0`).

---

### 15. Pipeline PATCH has no bounds on priority or notes
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM · **Area:** `PATCH /api/v1/pipeline/{client_id}` (`PipelineUpdate` schema)

```
PATCH {priority: 999999999}     → 200, stored
PATCH {priority: -100}          → 200, stored
PATCH {notes: 'x'.repeat(102400)} → 200, 100 KB stored verbatim
```

Both fields were reset after probing.

XSS probe: `{notes: '<img src=x onerror="window.__PWNED=true">'}` was stored as-is; after navigating to `/pipeline` the script **did not execute** (React escapes text children by default), but the raw string appeared as visible text on the card. Today this is not exploitable — but the unbounded field + stored HTML becomes a persistent-XSS vector the moment anything downstream uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on notes.

**Fix:** on `schemas/pipeline.py`, add `priority: int = Field(default=0, ge=0, le=100)` and `notes: str = Field(default='', max_length=4000)`.

### 16. Feedback GET returns 500 for non-UUID path
**Severity:** 🟠 HIGH (a 500 is a server-error breadcrumb — should be a 4xx) · **Area:** `GET /api/v1/feedback/{feedback_id}` (`backend/app/api/v1/feedback.py:274`)

```
GET /api/v1/feedback/not-a-uuid   → 500 Internal Server Error   ❌
GET /api/v1/jobs/not-a-uuid        → 422 Unprocessable Entity   ✅
GET /api/v1/companies/not-a-uuid   → 422 Unprocessable Entity   ✅
```

Root cause: `feedback_id: str` at `feedback.py:276` (also 292, 115, 162). `db.get(Feedback, "not-a-uuid")` bubbles a Postgres cast error up as a 500.

**Fix:** change the path-param annotations to `feedback_id: UUID` and import `from uuid import UUID`. Pydantic will then auto-422 for malformed UUIDs.

### 17. Himalayas fetcher hard-caps at 1020 jobs per scan
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM · **Area:** `backend/app/fetchers/himalayas.py:62-63`

```python
# Safety limit — fetch up to 1000 jobs per scan
if offset > 1000:
    break
```

Last 3 scans (`GET /api/v1/platforms/scan-logs?platform=himalayas&limit=3`):
```
jobs_found: 1020, new_jobs: 931, duration_ms: 30660
jobs_found: 1020, new_jobs: 617, duration_ms: 20568
jobs_found: 1020, new_jobs: 933, duration_ms: 22647
```

Identical `jobs_found` with fluctuating `new_jobs` implies the Himalayas catalog is >1020 and each scan grabs a slightly different subset of the head. This is the structural driver behind part of **Finding #7** (himalayas 180 accumulated errors) — we likely keep re-inserting/updating the same ~1020 rows while the tail is never seen.

**Fix options:**
1. Lift the cap (e.g. to 5000) if latency stays acceptable — simplest.
2. Switch to incremental pagination: persist the highest `pubDate` we saw, only fetch newer-than that next scan.
3. Keep the cap, but rotate the `offset` seed per run so we cycle through the catalog.

### 18. `/jobs?search=Stripe` returns 3 but Stripe has 61 jobs
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM · **Area:** search routing / deployment integrity

```
GET /api/v1/companies?search=stripe
  → {total: 1, items: [{name: "Stripe", job_count: 61}]}
GET /api/v1/jobs?company_id=89619c2c-46d4-470e-a696-0292e4936ec1
  → {total: 61}     ✅ direct company filter works
GET /api/v1/jobs?search=Stripe
  → {total: 3}      ❌ only title matches come through
GET /api/v1/jobs?search=Stripe&status=all
  → {total: 0}      ❌ default-status override breaks results entirely
```

Commit `212830a` added `Job.company.has(Company.name.ilike(...))` at `jobs.py:76`, which should return all 61. Either:
- The backend container hasn't been rebuilt / redeployed yet (fix is in git, not on the running process).
- `joinedload(Job.company)` is fine, but the EXISTS subquery behind `has()` might hit a different Company row than expected (e.g. jobs whose `company_id` points to a company named "Stripe, Inc." vs "Stripe").

**Next step:** hit `/api/v1/monitoring/health` (or similar) to confirm the deployed commit SHA; if it still shows `b2cb1d4` / pre-fix, trigger a redeploy first. If it already says `212830a`, add a server-side log of the generated SQL to see why the `has()` branch returns 0.

Also: the `status=all` permutation going to **0** (not 3) is suspicious — looks like `status=all` is treated as a literal enum value by the handler rather than as "no filter". Worth a separate look at `jobs.py:56-57`.

### 19. Missing defensive response security headers
**Severity:** 🔵 LOW · **Area:** HTTP response headers (origin + Cloudflare edge)

`curl -sI https://salesplatform.reventlabs.com/api/v1/auth/me`:
```
✅ x-content-type-options: nosniff
✅ x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN
✅ x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
✅ referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
❌ Content-Security-Policy                       (missing)
❌ Strict-Transport-Security                     (missing)
❌ Permissions-Policy                            (missing)
❌ Cross-Origin-{Opener,Embedder,Resource}-Policy (missing)
```

Login-cookie flags (from `POST /api/v1/auth/login`):
`Set-Cookie: session=…; HttpOnly; Max-Age=86400; Path=/; SameSite=lax; Secure` ✅

The JWT is also echoed in the JSON body (not just the cookie), but `Object.keys(localStorage)` is `[]` after login — so the frontend does not persist it anywhere JS-reachable. Fine.

**Fix (cheap):** add HSTS + a starter CSP at the Cloudflare edge (Rules → Transform Rules → HTTP Response Header Modification). Start CSP in `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` mode so we don't break the existing bundle.

### 20. Role-cluster `name` accepts arbitrary characters
**Severity:** 🔵 LOW · **Area:** `POST /api/v1/role-clusters`

Probe:
```
POST /api/v1/role-clusters
{ "name": "test'); DROP TABLE role_cluster_config;--",
  "display_name": "x", "keywords": "test", "approved_roles": "" }
→ 200 OK; name stored as "test');_drop_table_role_cluster_config;--"
```

Not SQLi (SQLAlchemy params are safe). But `name` is used as a URL query value (e.g. `/jobs?role_cluster=<name>`) and as a key in UI state — punctuation, whitespace, or quotes silently surviving normalization will bite us later.

**Fix:** in `schemas/role_config.py`, restrict `name` via `Field(..., pattern=r'^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{1,30}$')` so the cluster key stays URL-safe.

Test cluster was deleted via `DELETE /api/v1/role-clusters/<id>` → 200 OK.

## 12. Observations from the retest (no finding, FYI)

- **RBAC sanity:** as `admin`, `/users` and `/auth/register` correctly return 403; `/role-clusters` POST correctly allowed. OK.
- **UUID handling:** `/jobs/not-a-uuid` → 422, `/companies/not-a-uuid` → 422, `/pipeline/{non-uuid}/stage` → 404. Consistent except feedback (Finding 16).
- **Pagination bounds:** `page=0` → 422, `page=999999999` → 200 with empty items + correct `total_pages`, `page_size=-1` → 422, `page_size=9999` → 422 (clamped at 200). Sensible.
- **Silent sort fallback:** `sort_by=malicious_column` → 200 with default sort (first_seen_at). Safe but no error signal — consider 422 for unknown sort columns.
- **Finding #10 retest:** the "1name" card still exists at id `73617d28-a631-46d5-bc45-934c9b135cfc` with `total_open_roles: 123, accepted_jobs_count: 1, stage: researching`. Awaiting the data-cleanup task the fixer flagged.
