# Releases

Chronological log of production releases to `salesplatform.reventlabs.com`.
Newest at the top. Each entry is one merge to `main` that triggered a deploy
via [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

**How this file is maintained.** The deploy workflow appends a stub entry
automatically on every successful merge-to-main run (see the `append-release`
step in `deploy.yml`). The stub contains: short SHA, tag, UTC timestamp, and
the commit subject. A human can then edit the stub to add the "why it
matters" line — keep it user-facing, one sentence, no implementation details.

**Format per entry:**

```
## YYYY-MM-DD · <short-sha> · <tag>
<one-line commit subject>

<optional one-sentence user-facing summary>
```

The one-line commit subject is the machine-written bit; the user-facing
summary is the human edit. Entries with only the subject (no summary) are
still-to-be-annotated — fine to leave as-is for minor fixes.

For per-feature deep-dives, the `docs/releases/` subdirectory holds the
long-form writeups (one `.md` per notable round). This file is the index.

Merge release/v0.1.1


# v0.1.1 — 2026-04-17

Version bump consolidating everything merged to `main` since v0.1.0
(initial tag). Backend + frontend both move to `0.1.1`. No breaking
changes, no migrations beyond those already shipped with the features
below; safe to roll forward.

**What users see:**

* **Cover letters now use Claude Opus 4.7** (was Sonnet 4). Noticeably
  more specific to the job posting and the candidate's résumé phrasing;
  fewer generic "excited to leverage" openings. Resume customization
  and interview prep stay on Sonnet 4 — higher volume, different
  quality needs.
* **Answer Book fills itself from your résumé.** Uploading or switching
  an active résumé auto-populates email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub into
  the Answer Book. The "Import from Resume" button is gone — it was
  redundant.
* **LinkedIn is now a credential slot.** Each résumé can carry its
  LinkedIn profile URL (and optional login) alongside the ATS creds.
* **Submit link, review queue priority, Applied action** — three sales
  workflow features from earlier this sprint are now live end-to-end.
  Paste an ATS URL to import one job; review queue orders by
  today/yesterday/older + best resume fit; `P` on the review card marks
  a job applied with an immutable snapshot of the resume text used.
* **Skill Gaps page reflects current demand** instead of the oldest 500
  jobs in the DB. Missing-skills list now shifts with real hiring
  signal.
* **`GET /api/v1/companies/enrichment-coverage`** (admin) — visibility
  into how many companies have been enriched, what's pending, and top
  recent errors.

**What changed under the hood (operator-facing):**

* **Discovery actually adds boards now.** Beat schedule calls
  `discover_and_add_boards` instead of `run_discovery`; previously
  `discovered_companies` filled up but nothing got promoted to
  `company_ats_boards`. Cap of 200 promotions per run prevents a
  Greenhouse-sitemap flood; stale-cull backstops any dead slugs.
* **Enrichment covers the long tail.** The batch task no longer hard-
  filters on `is_target=True` — any company with an active ATS board
  is eligible, with `is_target DESC` preserving priority ordering.
  786-company corpus converges in ~16h at the default 50/hour cap.
* **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY leak defense.** `SecretStr` at the config layer,
  log-scrubbing filter at the root logger + Celery worker, extended
  pre-commit regex, `.env` auto-write from GH Secrets via ci-deploy.sh
  stdin contract.
* **Backend CI unblocked.** Alembic migrations pass on a fresh DB
  (dropped the FK to the un-migrated `ai_customization_logs` table);
  new `test_smoke.py` runs 10 regression guards on SecretStr + the
  scrubber.
* **F228 fix.** `GET /applications` accepts `?submission_source=`
  (the column was response-only before).
* **Release log automation.** `docs/RELEASES.md` now gets a stub
  entry prepended on every green deploy (see `append-release` job
  in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

**Fix rollup below** (chronological, newest first).

Merge fix/skill-gaps-order-by-freshness: pin sample to newest 500 jobs

Skill-gaps page stopped silently reporting stale market demand — samples
now reflect the 500 most recently ingested jobs instead of the oldest.

## 2026-04-17 · 9b25f2f · auto
Merge fix/ci-pytest-ignore-live-integration: unblock backend test job

Backend CI test job goes green; added 10 real smoke tests as regression
guards on the SecretStr + log-scrubber leak defenses.

Merge: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY leak defense (SecretStr + log scrubber + hook)

Three-layer protection so the Anthropic key can never reach logs,
commit messages, or stringified settings dumps.

## 2026-04-17 · 8d3d097 · auto
Merge fix/f228-applications-submission-source-filter

`GET /applications` now honours `?submission_source=…`; new "Source"
dropdown on the Applications page.

## 2026-04-17 · aecb3ca · auto
Merge deploy.yml: pipe ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to ci-deploy.sh via stdin

Rotating the Anthropic key is now a GH Secret update + re-run —
no SSH-and-edit on the VM.

## 2026-04-17 · c45ec13 · auto
Merge fix/ci-migration-ai-log-fk: unblock CI + deploy

Alembic upgrade no longer fails on a fresh DB (FK to the un-migrated
ai_customization_logs table dropped, UUID type aligned with repo
convention).

## 2026-04-17 · 89966cc · auto
Merge feat/manual-link-review-priority-applied

Three sales-workflow features shipped together:

* **Submit job link** — paste an ATS URL, server fetches + scores the
  posting through the same pipeline the scanners use.
* **Review queue prioritization** — today / yesterday / older date
  buckets + team-wide best resume fit ordering.
* **Applied action** — marks a job submitted with an immutable snapshot
  of the resume text and score used at submit time.
